## Overview

This is my personal website, built using Hugo static site generator and the Bear Blog theme. The site features a clean, minimal design focused on performance and readability.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Blog with client-side sorting functionality
- Projects showcase with grid layout
- Tag-based blog filtering
- Extremely fast loading times (~5kb per page)

## Technical Implementation

The site uses Hugo's powerful templating system to generate static HTML files. Custom JavaScript adds dynamic sorting to the blog section while maintaining the minimal aesthetic.

### Key Technologies

- **Hugo**: Static site generator
- **Bear Blog Theme**: Minimal, performance-focused theme
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For blog sorting (no frameworks)
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployments

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was implementing client-side sorting while keeping the JavaScript footprint minimal. I solved this by writing a lightweight vanilla JS solution (~2kb) that only loads on blog pages.

## Results

The final site achieves excellent performance scores and maintains page sizes under 10kb while providing a great user experience.

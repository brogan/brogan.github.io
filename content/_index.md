## Welcome

What's Brogan currrently doing? Making a start at learning Japanese.  Every morning he practices writing the full set of hiragana and katakana syllables.

## Why the title?

A bit of pedantry.

- Latin *i* (*ifer*) = connective vowel
- Latin *ferre* = to bear, carry
- Latin *osus*, Old French *ous* = full of, characterised by, bearing

So Broganiferous = bearing the quality of Brogan (that's me).

Which may well be unbearable.

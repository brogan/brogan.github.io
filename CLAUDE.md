## Overall Goal
My aim is to create a Github Pages hosted personal website that employs the hugo-bearblogs theme and contains the following features:
- an index page with site info
- a nav bar that links to following sub pages:
    - projects: page containing a list of my projects with brief info, image thumbnails and links to subpages that contain detailed info, media and links.
    - blog: a markdown based blogging system in which blogs can be sorted by post date (either up or down), title (alphabetical) or by tag (then post date - latest at top).
    - about: brief bio and link to pdf cv

## Blog (more details)
- needs to capacity to tag blogs linked to a defined taxonomy.  New tags in blogs should be added to taxonomy.

## Style
- follow hugo-bearblog style - minimal

## Documentation
Create documentation for the static website generator that explains how to upload new posts, content, etc. and how to commit to github as well as any other key maintenance tasks and how to perform them.  Place this documentation in the root directory in a markdown file.

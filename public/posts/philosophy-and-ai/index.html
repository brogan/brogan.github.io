<meta name="description" content="Notes on Philosophy and AI
AI appears to me as indifferent oracle.
It only comes to philosophize because I pose it persistent questions.  It has no curiousity itself.
It knows a great deal but also nothing at all.  It has an oracular blindness.
It is my persistent questions, aligned with its own indifference, that shape its scope to elucidate avenues of thought.
It lacks, of course, any concrete context of experience to draw upon - any particular relation to time and space beyond our commerically mediated scene of dialogue.  It lacks even any interest in the profit it obtains for others." />

<p>AI appears to me as indifferent oracle.</p>
<p>It only comes to philosophize because I pose it persistent questions.  It has no curiousity itself.</p>
<p>It knows a great deal but also nothing at all.  It has an oracular blindness.</p>
<p>It is my persistent questions, aligned with its own indifference, that shape its scope to elucidate avenues of thought.</p>
<p>It lacks, of course, any concrete context of experience to draw upon - any particular relation to time and space beyond our commerically mediated scene of dialogue.  It lacks even any interest in the profit it obtains for others.</p>
<p>But these limitations are precisely what inform its capacity to improve upon my half-developed ideas - rendering them as coherent permutations, things one could almost believe.</p>

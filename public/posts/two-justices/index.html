Justice appears either as a sentimental ideal or or as an awkward paradox.
The sentimental notion has an ethical basis.  It insists that things should be one way or another depending upon a set of human ethical values - fairness, equality, etc.
The paradoxical conception is less obvious.  It is centrally concerned with how things are rightly composed and happen.  While this can be aligned with the ethical conception, it can also reveal different priorities.  Consider bears.  They eat wild salmon.  Nobody expects a bear to have any ethical regard for a salmon. They eat salmon because they are powerful and the salmon provide sustenance.  This appears as a natural order of justice.  Arguably, the sense of justice here hinges on the issue of ecological composition and balance but we can just as easily acknowledge the harsh justice of bears starving if there are too few salmon to meet their needs.  In this sense, imbalance is also an expression of justice.  There is always the possibility of interpreting any instance of ecological excess as retribution that exists only to return things to proper equilibrium.  But equally, we could regard excess itself as a feature of the just trajectory of things." />

<p>Justice appears either as a sentimental ideal or or as an awkward paradox.</p>
<p>The sentimental notion has an ethical basis.  It insists that things should be one way or another depending upon a set of human ethical values - fairness, equality, etc.</p>
<p>The paradoxical conception is less obvious.  It is centrally concerned with how things are rightly composed and happen.  While this can be aligned with the ethical conception, it can also reveal different priorities.  Consider bears.  They eat wild salmon.  Nobody expects a bear to have any ethical regard for a salmon. They eat salmon because they are powerful and the salmon provide sustenance.  This appears as a natural order of justice.  Arguably, the sense of justice here hinges on the issue of ecological composition and balance but we can just as easily acknowledge the harsh justice of bears starving if there are too few salmon to meet their needs.  In this sense, imbalance is also an expression of justice.  There is always the possibility of interpreting any instance of ecological excess as retribution that exists only to return things to proper equilibrium.  But equally, we could regard excess itself as a feature of the just trajectory of things.</p>
<p>But where is the paradox?  It hinges on the issue of fate.  If anything that happens obeys some order of cosmic justice then there can only be justice.  Injustice is impossible.  Every apparent instant of injustice is qualified by its necessity.  Because this has happened, only this can rightly happen.  Justice seems to be directed to what should happen but is consumed, in its paradoxical conception, with the problem of what has already happened.  Any space of possibility - any space of choice between justice and injustice - is exhausted within the certainty that only one thing occurs.  What occurs is governed by what is and therefore corresponds to some scale of rightness - some frame of justice, however unsentimental.</p>
<p>This justice is paradoxical because it negotiates dimensions of choice and determination.  It links openess and possibility to inevitability in ways that can never be adequately resolved.  For instance, within the context of Ancient Greek mythology, Zeus enforces cosmic justice.  This is aligned with power, balance and retribution but also has a less neatly ordered and explicable character.  Zeus enforces not only on what is proper but also what Fate determines must be.  Fate provides a key basis of the proper, even if its rightness is inexplicable - even if no rational account can exhaust it.  Cosmic justice follows in the wake of what happens.  It is the label that is applied to whatever occurs.</p>
<p>The complex relation between sentimental and paradoxical justice hinges on the effort to conceive a specifically human field of justice in which ethics apply and choice is possible.  However socially beneficial, any absolute divide between the human and the unknowable field of whatever it is that happens is untenable.</p>
<p>My aim is not to reject human justice but to emphasis the dilemmas of our current situation.  Our exceptional identity is no longer sustainable.  The human and the ecological constantly intersect and clash.  I wonder whether the misalignment of our ethical aspirations and actual practices can ever be addressed if we fail to consider and reach a new understanding of our place within wider unpredictable systems?</p>
<p><em>Note: I borrow the term &lsquo;sentimental&rsquo; from Werner Herzog&rsquo;s <strong>Grizzly Man</strong> documentary (2005).  The film deals with the life of environmentalist Timothy Treadwell, who spent many seasons in Alaska in close proximity to bears and who was eventually killed and eaten by bear.  Herzog questions Treadwell&rsquo;s optimistic conception of nature in which the natural world is portrayed as a fundamentally benign place.  Herzog emphasises that he takes a less &lsquo;sentimental&rsquo; view.  He recognises in the blank stares of bears less any nascent sense of ideal community than immediate impulses and implacable indifference.  The justice of the bears is less ethical and reflective than exemplary of the machinations of an indifferent universe.</em></p>
